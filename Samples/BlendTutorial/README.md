This is the sample corresponding to the [Blend Integration](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core.BlendTutorial.html) tutorial.

Blend produces a visual design that is represented by a text file in [XAML](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core.XamlIntroduction.html) format. Just as HTML is the markup language for web applications, XAML is the markup language for Blend applications. These XAML files, together with other resources such as images or fonts, will be the input of NoesisGUI applications.

This tutorial is based on *Microsoft Blend* for *Visual Studio*, and will show you how to use it to design application user interfaces to be imported and executed by NoesisGUI framework.
