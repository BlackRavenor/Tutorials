![Screenshot](https://github.com/Noesis/Noesis.github.io/blob/master/NoesisGUI/Samples/IntegrationGLUT/Screenshot.png)

This is the sample corresponding to the [Integration](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core.SDKGuide.html) tutorial.

Minimal integration sample using *GLUT* and *NoesisGUI*. For simplification purposes, this example is not complete (for example, only mouse input events are handled). For a full multiplatform integration code with step by step comments have a look at the [Integration](https://github.com/Noesis/Tutorials/tree/master/Samples/Integration) sample.
