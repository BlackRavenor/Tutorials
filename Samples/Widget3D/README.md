This example shows how to use a Unity's *RenderTexture* to draw UI controls inside 3D scenes.

The XAML is rendered to a camera with a RenderTexture target. That texture is then used in the material assigned to a 3D object in the scene.

It also showcases how to use Noesis controls to interact with Unity's game objects. Here *ToggleButtons* are used to switch lights on and off, as well as *Sliders* to control the intensity of the lights.

## Unreal
