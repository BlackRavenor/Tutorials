This is the sample corresponding to the [Touch and Manipulation](http://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core.TouchTutorial.html) tutorial.

NoesisGUI enables having user interfaces that receive multiple touches simultaneously. A *touch* is a type of user input generated by putting fingers on a touch-sensitive screen. You can manage touch events in NoesisGUI at three different levels: *Native* controls, *Touch* events and *Manipulations* events.
