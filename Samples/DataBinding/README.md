This is the sample corresponding to the [DataBinding](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core.DataBindingTutorial.html) tutorial.

NoesisGUI provides a simple and powerful way to auto-update data between the business model and the user interface. This mechanism is called *Data Binding*. They key to data binding is a [Binding](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core._Binding.html) object that "glues" two properties together and keeps a channel of communication open between them. You can set a *Binding* once, and then have it do all the synchronization work for the remainder of the application's lifetime.

In this tutorial we will explain the different ways you might want to use data binding.
