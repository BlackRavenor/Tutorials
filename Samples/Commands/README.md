This is the sample corresponding to the [Commands](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core.CommandsTutorial.html) tutorial.

Command is one of the important components of any [MVVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) (Model-View-ViewModel) application. *MVVM* architectures help with decoupling the components of an application to make the application easier to unit test, maintain and extend.

*MVVM* pattern can be implemented in NoesisGUI by using commands and a *ViewModel* class. The *ViewModel* is the class in charge of binding data to the XAML and implementing the delegate that will be invoked by the command.
