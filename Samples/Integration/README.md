# Integration Sample

This is the sample corresponding to the [Integration](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core.SDKGuide.html) tutorial.

This is an annotated minimal multiplatform sample using NoesisGUI. For more advanced and realistic scenarios follow the rest of samples. The only purpose of this sample is being very clear about each step. With that in mind, we don't use the *Application framework* here. Only a few abstraction classes (*Display* and *RenderContext*) are used to remain multiplatform.
