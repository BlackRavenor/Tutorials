# RenderTexture Sample

This example shows how to use a Unity's *RenderTexture* to draw XAMLs as textures inside 3D scenes.

The XAML is rendered to a camera with a RenderTexture target. That texture is used then in the material assigned to a 3D object in the scene.

It also showcases how to use Noesis controls to interact with Unity's game objects. In this example 2 skinned *ToggleButtons* are used to switch two lights on and off, as well as 2 *Sliders* to control the intensity of the lights.
